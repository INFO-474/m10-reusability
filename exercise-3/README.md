## Calc.js

The functions you should implement and document are as follows:

- Calc(number)
- Calc.getVal()
- Calc.plus(number)
- Calc.minus(number)
- Calc.times(number)
- Calc.divide(number)
- Calc.clear()

***Documentation:***

You should include a block of JavaScript code showing how to use your library. Additionally you should provide a function reference for each function in the Calc library. The first one has been done for you so you have a good idea of how it should be formatted.

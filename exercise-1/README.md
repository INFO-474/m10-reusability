## Exercise 1: Building a Treemap

This exercise is a more robust opportunity to visualize data using D3. Data on the life expectancy and GDP of countries has been prepared after downloading it from the [World Bank Website](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators). As usual, once you fork and clone this repository, instructions will appear in the `index.html` and `js/main.js` files. Unlike previous exercises, this exercise details high-level requirements rather than writing out step-by-step instructions.

Your final product should look like this

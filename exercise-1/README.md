## Exercise 1: Getter / Setter Methods

The purpose of this exercise is to practice writing getter/setter methods on an object (which will be the same for a function-object later in the module). Unlike other exercises, this exercise will be all in JavaScript / in the console (i.e., you will not be interacting with the DOM). As usual, fork and clone this repository, then follow the instructions in the `index.html` and `main.js` files.
